M ETAMORPHOSES XI. 16-26

16. infracto Berecyntia tibia cornu. In the worship of Cybele
on Mt. Berecyntus the flute was especially used. The Phrygian
pipe was rounded off by a hom end ; cf. iii. 533 ‘adunco tibia cornu',
and Cat. Attis, 22 ‘ Tibicen ubi canit Phryx curvo grave calamo.’

17. tympana, ‘kettledrum'‚ the mystic instrument of Cybele.
It had been introduced into the festivals of Bacchus, with the ritual
of which the Phrygian cult had much in common. Exciting music
os this kind has played a large part in orgiastic religions‚ both
ancient and modern.

Bacchei ululatus. Two points are to be noticed here ε (1) the
hiatus in the fifth foot‚ cf. 933 (2) the ending with a word of four
syllables, cf. 456. Both peculiarities are imitations of Greek
prosody and are in Latin especially found with Greek words. Cf.
Verg. Ecl. ii. 24 ‘in Actaeo Aracyntho ’.

19. non exauditi: with causal force.

20. attonitas, ‘spellbound.’ attonitus, lit. ‘thunderstruck’‚ is
used figuratively of the stupefaction caused by not only sur-
prise, but sear, joy, sorrow, or any strong cniotion; ‘astonish'
is often found in older English with this general signification.
Milton, P.L. i. 316:

‘ If such astonishment as this can seize
Eternal spirits!

22, Orphei titulum . . . theatri—in apposition to v. 21. ‘the
glorious audience of Orpheus.’ For titulus and thcalrum see
vocabulary. triumphi is also read and would go very well with
titulus. 13ut the best MSS. give lltcalri, though it is awkward to
have tltcalro in 25 following so closely. Such repetitions occur not
infrequently in the Alclazmzvpltoscs, which never received Ovid's
final revision. See his ‘ envoi ³, p. xx.

Orphei: adjective.

23. cruentatis: they tore the animals to pieces. So divulsere,
38, and cf. Eur. Bacchae, 739. Such scenes of animals cruelly dis-
ineinbered and eaten raw were characteristic os the Bacchic orgies,
and froin them the god was called Dionysus Omophagus—catcr of
raw tlesh. Swinbume, ⁸ bloodfeasts os the lxassarids)

24. luce: ahl. of tiinc.

25. noctis avem : the owl.
