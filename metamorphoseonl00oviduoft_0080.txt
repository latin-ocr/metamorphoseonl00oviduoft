METAMORPHOSES xl. 5¹4-543

514. cerae: the caulking of wax. Pitch was more generally used
sor this purpose.

517. credas: ‘potential ’ subj.‚ 8⁴ n.

519-20. Two weak lines. The inclusion of ‘ vela madent
nimbis* in the dreadful circumstances of the shipwreck comes
perilously near bathos. For‘ undis. .aquae’, we should expect

‘aquis. .’undae ,'mzdzs being a most inappropriate expression in
this connexion for, the waters from heaven. The inversion seems
harsh and pointless.

521. caeca: perhaps passive, ‘dark‚' ‘impenetrable.'

525. numero: sc. commilitonum.

526. defensae = quae defenditur, for the action of the participle
is not past in reference to that of the verb adsiluit. This
‘ timeless' use of the past. part. (corresponding to the Greek ‘aorist ⁹)
is rare, except in the case of deponent verbs. M. 431 b and obs. 1.

527. spe ε what is hoped sor, the object of his ambition.

528. tamen: to be taken with unus, ‘though single-handed‚
still! Like the Greek ὅμως, tamen is often so used as a concise
equit-alent of the longer form with quamquam. Cp. Verg. Ecl. i. 28
‘libertas‚ quae sera tamen respexit inertem‘‚ and the beautiful
injstanse (which defles translation) in Aen. iv. 328 (quoted on 272
a ove .

530. decimae. The Romans believed that each tenth wave was
larger and more powerful than its forerunners. Cf. T rist. i. 2. 49:

‘qui venit hic fluctus, fluctus supereminet omnes,
posterior nono est, undecimoque prior.’

The kindred word decimanus thus became a synonym for ‘ huge '.
Lucilius, the Roman satirist (180-103 B.C.)‚ reproves Gallonius, a
notorious glutton, for squandering all his substance on a ‘monstrous
sturgeon '—ac1'pensere decimano.

impetus undae, ‘the wave, in its onslaught.'

532. Order: ‘ quam descendat velut in moenia captae urbis.’

descendat τ subj.‚ because purpose or motive is implied.
Bradley, ᾖ 442.

moenia = ‘ walls of oak ⁹, bulwarks.

533. pars: sc. maris.

538. mortes: here ‘ hazards of death ⁹. The plural is rare:
cf. Verg. Aen. x. 854 ‘omnes per mortes animam sontem ipse
dedissem '‚ where mortes = different forms of death.

540. funera: 429¹]-

541. inrita: cognate accus, to be trans. adverbially, 4ο.

542. subeunt: sc. animum.

543. pignoribus, ‘pledges os affection) children are ‘pledges¹
as being security sor the mutual affection of their parents. The
word also retains part ofits primary meaning, sor a man's offspring
would be thc first to be chosen :ts a hostage for his good behaviour.
