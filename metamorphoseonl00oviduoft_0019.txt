THE M ETAMORPHOSES xx·

cases a marked independence of treatment. Only on these terms,
indeed, could the ear of his public have been won at all. The
same consideration doubtless explains why Ovid, with the instinct
of the rat-entem, passes rapidly over themes which schoolmaster
and poetaster‚ Orbilius and Bavius and Maevius between them.
had already done to death.¹

Two points in the conduct of his subject may be taken to illustrate
Ovid’s art. (ι) The transitions from one legend to another, (2) the
descriptions of the transformations.

(1) By means of the skilful transitions, one episode after another is
woven into the texture os the work. Their introduction is justified in
various ways; by the general similarity of the tale to be related to
the preceding story ; by the similarity of the transformation, or the
identity of scene; or the story belongs to the same god or man;
hymns are sung, as by Orpheus, or songs‚ as by the Minyeides at their
looms, celebrating transformations ; a person is mentioned as absent
from a scene or a company, and this circumstance is explained in
a fresh story. Very rarely is there anything like a break in the story‚‘·’
although the connexion is occasionally st'rained and far-setched‚and
once, at least, Ovid does violence to geography in order to secure
a transition.²‘

(2) ln describing the transformations‚ the poet’s skill is shown in
the gradual adaptation of the human being, part by part„to the
being or thing which results from the change. Nothing in the
poem more sully justifies Macaulay's praise that ‘ in ingenuity and
the ait of doing difficult things in expression and versification as if
they were the easiest in the world, Ovid is incomparable '. Some
os the forms os metamorphosis, e. g. that into a plant or tree‚ occur
frequently, and afford the poet an opportunity os displaying his
never-sailing variety. He is no less successful with that which has
no parts—stone and water; and we osten find further refinentents
like ii. 672 (of Ocyrrhoe, changed into a mare),

‘ longaeki‘fflrs maxima pallae
cauda fit.’

¹ Cf. the episode of the building os Troy and the punishment os Laomedon
194-220, where the poet gives only the main points os the story. He is
evidently eager to proceed to the story os Peleus. Hence, too, the slight
thread os connexion at 21 7.
