LIFE AND WORKS OF Ole ix

incursions of the Scythians against the town whenever the frozen
Danube gave them passage, and in consequence a tardy novitiate in
warfare for the poet; the poisoned arrows of these foemen dropping
in the main ways of the town. All these and other disagoeeables,
superadded to his great and enduring regret for Rome, were far
from being counterbalanced by the hospitable reception which the
Tomitans accorded to the distinguished sojourner in their midst.

Ovid never ceased to petition sor pardon, but his protestations of
innocence and abject pleas sor the remission, or at least the allevia-
tion‚ of his sentence, were unheeded by Augustus, and Tiberius, his
successor, never very ready to reverse the measures and policy of
his stepsather‚ proved equally inflexible. Ovid died in exile at the
age os60 in 18 ΑΛ).

At Tomi he composed :—

(1) The wistia, in five books—elegies on his banishment.

(2) The Epistolae ex Ponto, in four books—letters addressed to
various friends.

Also other minor compositions‚ including a poem in the Getic
language, in praise of Augustus, which has not come down to us.

In spite of our knowledge of the facts of his life, we seem to know
little of the man. But though he is not a hero, one is bound to like
him. His saulis and vices are those of his time, and they lie on
the surface; as with Cicero in his letters, his frank confession of his
weaknesses disarms hostility. And he has the redeeming virtues
of good nature, generosity, and human sympathy. Macaulay

fairly sums up his character as follows : ‘He seems to have been
a very good fellow ς rather too fond os woinen3 a flatterer and a

coward ; but kind and generous ; and free from envy‚ though a man
of letters, and though sufficiently vain of his own performances.‘
