But the poet has the desects of his qualities. He lacked ‘ the last
and greatest art-the art to blot '. When he likes, he can phrase
an epigram with the finished conciseness of a Juvenal, but only too
often his facility and lack ofrestraint led him into tasteless ‘ conceits’
and witticisms‚ and into tautology and redundance of expression.
As Quintilian says of him,1 he is ‘too fond of his own cleverness ⁹. A
good instance os this repetition is i. 89-93‚ where he expresses in
six several ways the idea that in the Golden Age there was no need
of the coercion of law.²' Such enlargements on a text occur most
commonly, by reason of the theme and the metre‚ in the Heroides,
but there are many instances in the Aletammssltoses, notably in the
speeches. Yet they are for the most part executed with such
cleverness, and (ostent with such telling rhetorical effect, that
though instructive and amusing, it is not altogether just to reduce
Ovid's exuberance to a cold summary in prose, as Dr. Postgate⁸
has done sor a few lines of Heroides xiv, for the purpose os reveal-
ing the meagreness (and sometimes inanity) of the thought which
it expresses or conceals.

There remains the other fault already noted—lack os taste and
propriety in the use of wit and ‘conceit’.⁴ This is especially ap-
parent in some of Ovid's Personifications, and distigures what
would otherwise be the most successful descriptions os this kind in
Latin poetry.⁵ And instances osa more general character might be
multiplied indefinitely. At 701 (where see note) the readiness os
