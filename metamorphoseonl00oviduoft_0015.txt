OVlD AND THE AUGUSTAN AGE xi

In his earlier works, the Amores and Ars Amatoria, the poet
holds up, without pretence of shame, a faithful mirror to the gilded
society in which he moved. Of that circle he was an honoured
and distinguished member, and in applauding him it applauded
itself. Religion and morality‚ as he cynically shows us, had been
reduced by his world, the one to mere formalism,¹ the other to
a fraction of a moral code‚‘-' which barely suffices to hold society
together at all. Seriousness and austerity are virtues which such an
age finds intolerable‚ and dismisses as ‘ rusticity ’. lt declines to be
bored with serious interests even in its poetry‚ and its poets cannot
become suspect of moral earnestness and artistic sincerity without
sadly compromising their reputation for ‘urbanity ' with the elegant
sribbles of their world.

It was inevitable that such an environment should react on the ¹
genius of the poet. And unfortunately there came into vogue at
this time a system which tended to make poetry respond still more
readily to popular taste—the custom of recitatio, or the reading by
a poet os his works to the public.³ lt was idle to expect in society
audiences the serious interest and power of concentration essential
to the appreciation of elaborate compositions; the result was that
the poet wrote sor them what they wished to hear, and contented
himself with a slipshod accomplishment of those parts of his poem
which did notlend themselves to rhetorical effect. lt is unnecessary
to show in detail how this led to the characteristic desects of later
Latin poetry---lack of organic unity‚ the elaboration of the parts at
the expense of the whole, cxcess of detail in descriptions, straining
after effect, above all, strong rhetorical colouring. Of all these
tendencies Ovid betrays the symptoms. We can hardly be mistaken
in attributing them in part to his rhetorical naming, but most of all
to this custom oft-esiazti12, which only confirmed those faults in
poetica] compositions which in theory it should have donc much to
amend and eradicate.
