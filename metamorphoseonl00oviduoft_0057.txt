METAMORPHOSES XI. 1 1 5-1 26

115. admovit: ‘frequentative’ or ‘iterative’ perfect of present
time, as in the best prose. laverat, 116, contigerat, 122, and
miscuerat, 125, are the corresponding pluperfects of past time.
R. 1717, Bradley, ξ 434.

videntur, ‘are seen!

116. Here, as in 121, the ille is redundant.

117. palmis: simple abl. of separation, where prose would
require a preposition (29).

Danaen‚ A skilsul reference to the golden shower, in which
form Jupiter obtained admission to Danae, confined by her
father Acrisius, king of Argos, in an inaccessible castle.
iv. 611 ‘Persea quem pluvio Danae conceperat auro '. william
Mortis has a beautiful version of the story in ‘The Doom of King
Acrisius ’.

123. convellere, ‘ chew.’

dente: i. e. he tried to evade the transformation by not using
his hands.

124. premebat here = legebat, ‘spread over', as in ix. 3 5 3 ‘lentus
premit inguina cortex'.

125. auctorem muneris. The Latin poets often substitute for the
product or province of a god the name or description of the god
himself. So Mars stands for war, Ceres (112) for corn, bread, Vul-
canus for fire, and here ‘auctorem muneris'=Bacchus=wine. The
convention is burlesqued by Juvenal, vii. 24, 25:

‘ uae
componis dona Veneris, Telesine, m‘firitoss

i.e. commit your scribblings to the flames, my poor bard.

The ‘conceit' here is artificial in the extreme, but quite typical
of Ovid. There is a similar frigidity in xii. 614 ‘ armarat deus idem,
idemque cremarat ’ (of Achilles, who had been armed by Neptune,
and was burnt on the funeral pyre). See 621 n. auctor here=
‘giver'. See Vocabulary. Ovid much affects the use os auctor
with a genitive, such phrases serving as 3 concise substitute sor
a relative clause.

125—6. miscuerat. . . . videres. The first sentence, though
- expressed independently (for rhetorical liveliness), is in sense subor-
dinate to the second. Cf. Juv. iii. 100:

‘rides, maiore cachinno
concutitur: flet, si lacrimas conspexit amici,’

and Hor. Sat. i. 1. 45, i. 3. 15. English, in the same way, some-
times has parataxis (co-ordination) of clauses instead of hypotaxis
gsszorsdezsstion). Translate: ‘ Did he mix . . .? you might
