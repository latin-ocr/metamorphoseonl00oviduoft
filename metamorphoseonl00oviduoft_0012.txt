viii INTRODUCTION

his writings was only the official reason for his exile, for the Ars
Amatoria had been published ten years before, and Ovid, now in
the maturity of his powers, had gone far to retrieve his reputation,
as a man, by a more enduring marriage and the cultivation of more
influentia] and reputable friends, and as aserious poet by the larger
scope of his national poems the Alelczmorplzoses and Fasti. He may
even have hoped to succeed to the position which Vergil and Horace
had held with the emperor, as he had succeeded to their reputation
with the public.

It is useless to attempt to ascertain the real reason for this
crushing sentence. Ovid is afraid to permit himself any too explicit
reference to it. He protests that his offence was a blunder, not a
crime‚¹ and that he is punished because his ⁴ eyes unwittingly
beheld a scandal'.² Did he stumble on some dark court secret
which was dangerous or discreditable to Augustus himself? The

fact that he was banished, and not silenced once for all by the
executioner or the assassin, seems to exclude any such supposition.

The most probable theory is that he had been a consenting witness
or a confidant in some offence committed by a member of the
imperial family. It is impossible, at any rate, not to remark the
coincidence in the date of the poet's banishment and the disgrace
of the younger Julia. It may be that he had been privy to her
intrigue with Silanus.a

Like Cicero, he sailed to support his exile with manly endurance;
and he unfolds the somewhat monotonous ‘pageant of his bleeding
heart’ with a lack of restraint which eren a sympathetic reader is
apt to find jarring. But in palliation of his weakness we must
allow for the completeness of the transformation in his fortunes.
Ovid was a town-bred wit, unwarlike, somewhat effeminate. with all
his thoughts and interests engaged in the life of the gay and polished
circles of the pleasure-loving capital ; he was transplanted to a
semi-barbarous town on the contines of the empire. There every-
thing was bleak‚ cheerless, inhuinan-thc complete lack of congenial
society; the rigon-ons wintcrs with their interminablc snows: the
long-haircd san-matianis carcering wildly through the streets; tlte
