INTRODUCTION

1. LIFE AND WORKS OF OVlD

PUBLIUS OVIDIUS NASO was born at Sulmo (Sulmonal, a small
hill-town of the Peligni, about ninety miles to the east of Rome, on
the 20th of March, 43 B.C. His communicative sels-consciousness,
sostered by long years of dreary exile, which threw him back upon
his memories of the past, has furnished us with copious details of
his lise and literary activity.¹ The poet was descended from an
ancient and wealthy family of equestrian rank, and thus belonged
to the nobility of the Italian country towns. His father, ambitious
for the advancement of his two sons, destined them for a public
career by which they might rise to senatorial rank. Accordingly
Ovid and his brother Lucius, his elder by exactly a year, were sent
to the capital, in order that they might study and practise rhetoric,
an indispensable equipment for Roman public life, under Arellius
Fuscus and Porcius Latro, the best teache1·s of the day. Publius
had no turn sor advocacy ², and until his brother died at the early
age of twenty, his unprofitable versifying met with only remon-
strance and admonition from his practical father. But when he
became sole heir, and was no longer under the necessity of pursuing
a lucrative but irksome profession, he was allowed at last to give
free scope to his inclination for poetry. First, however, our poet
completed his education, after the manner of the young Roman
nobility, by a short sojourn at Athens, the university of the ancient
world and the home of art, belles-lettres, and philosophy. This
was followed by a Grand Tour, in the company of his friend and
fellow-poet Macer, through the Greek cities of Asia Minor and Sicily.

On his return to Rome, Ovid did not devote himself exclusively
to poetry. We find him, in strange incongruity with our conception
