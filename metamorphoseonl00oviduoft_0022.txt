xviii INTRODUCTION

Verse translations of Ovid have been few and far between in
recent γεω-5. Α specimen is appended of the graceful and
scholarly translation of the Metammplmses in blank verse by
Henry King. The passage selected is the famous description of
the Cave of Sleep, xi. 592—615 :—

⁴ fast by Cimmeria’s bounds the torpid home

Of Somnus stands: a cavernous hollow scooped
Deep in a mountain-side, where never ray

(if ntorn or noon or eve, with cheersul gleatn

Of sunlight finds an entrance :—-1nist and sog
From the dank soil upsteaming load the air,
And all the spot a doubtful twilight shrouds.
Never the crested bird of inorn awakes

Aurora from her couch 2-no watchdog there,

Or goose, more wakeful than the watehdog's belf.
'l'he silence breaks:—n0 beust, or wild or taine,
No wind-stirred forest-braneh‚ no intere-hange

Of human speech the dutnb dead quiet mars,
Unbroken save where from the mountain's base
A rivulet of Lethaean virtue puris

With tinkly murmur o'er a pebbly bed,

Inviting more to sleep. The threshold glou-ed
With §carlet wealth of poppies, and all herbs

Of sap to brew the slumberous charnis that Night
lixtracting, sprinkles o'et· the day-worn world.
No door in all the house to vex the ear

With creaking hinge 2-2110 guard. no lock, no bar
'l'o entrance. ln the cavern's midst reposed

On losty couch of ebon, piled with down

(vs black accordant pluumge, sable-draped.

His liinbs relaxed in sltunber, lay the (frod.
Phantastic in a thousand inimic forms,
Countless as ears in harvest—time, or leaves

ln summer-woods, or sands on occan's shore.
Around him couched his subject host of Diutius)
