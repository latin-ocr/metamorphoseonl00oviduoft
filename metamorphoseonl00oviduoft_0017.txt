THE METAMORPHOSES xiii

metempsychosis, which Pythagoras expounds in Book XIV, though
they furnish the poem with a kind of philosophical basis, nevertheless
strike the reader as being something osan afterthought.

lt is this Iack osa vital unifying conception, rather than the slight
nature os the theme, which distinguishes the lllclamorsslmses from
a poem like the Aeneid. We need not inquire minutely how sar
Ovid was indebted sor his subject to his predecessors. Trans-
formatioris occur in Greek literature as early as Homer, Hesiod,
and Simonides, and the subject was a favourite one with the
Alexandrian school. Ovid certainly owed something to the later
Greek writer Nicander,l possibly also to Parthenius.² But his
claim to originality of treatment lies in his perception that a mere
concatenation of legends, involving the conception of the gods as
supernatura! powers capriciously exercising their power for human
weal or woe‚ besides having only a remote interest for his own
rationalist day, was altogether too slight and too rnonotonous
a subject for an elaborate poem. He dexterously cast his net much
wider, so as to incorporate in his work no small part of the heroic
legentls. The actual transformations osten serve merely as a formal
justification of the brilliant episodes which hang by them and
vindicate the subject from the triviality which might otherwise
have been charged against it. One of the finest passages of the
poem is the description in Book 11 of the Suu-god‘s palace, and
the fatal charioteering of the hapless Phaethon. -Yet it is not
Phaethon that is transformed, but his hals-brother Cycnus and the
Heliades, his weeping sisters. In Book VIII the transformation of
Meleager's sisters into guinea-sowl is told in two lines, but these
serve to give the required conclusion to the long story of the hunt-
ing of the Calydonian boar, and of Meleager’s extinction. Moreover,
the poet gives the widest interpretation to the term ‘metamorphosis’.

¹ Nicander of Colophon (flor. c. 150 Β. C.) wrote, inter alia, a work on
Metamorphoses called Ἑτεροιούμενα, os which only a few words remain. We
know something os its contents from Antoninus Liberalis (flor. c. 150 Λ. u),
who summarized it.

² Parthenius os Nicaea opened a school of poetry in Rome about 54 P.. C.
Hc wrote a poem called Metamorphoses. We have no evidence that Ovid
drew upon this work, but in view os Parthenius’s prominent position in
Roman literary circles (he taught Vergil Greek* and Ovid's ready appre-

ciation (and assimilation* os the poetieal talent os his (lay. the inserence
seems highly probable.
