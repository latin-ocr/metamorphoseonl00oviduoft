METAMORPHOSES XI. 343—36 1

Caes. B. G. i. 2 ‘pro multitudine hominum . . . angustos se fines
habere arbitrantur ’.

345. dolens . . . dolendi. Repetition of this kind isa favourite
device of the poet, and is especially common with a change of voice,
‘ deceptus decipit '‚ ἃς. Cf. 442, 3.

[346—409. Such tlte kl'ng's lale. 1 Vlaeen lo! there flz'es lo them the
herdsman wlwm Peleus had lest lo tend his cattle. Breallzless, lte
relates that a murderous woff is ltarrying tlte kine on tlte share.
‘ To arms! ’ But Peleus, conscience·strichen, sees in the wolf an
emissary (gf ltz‘s stepmotlzer‚ sent to (wenge lter murdered son, and
when Ceyx, to llis wzse's dismay, prqffi’rs leis armezl help against
tlte ravager‚ lte courteously declines. ‘ l'rayer alone will turn away
tlte Nereid‘s wrath! But leis petilian falls on deas ears : it is lest
sor Thetis lo intercede and procure pardon sor lter husband. But
the wolf, now grown z'nsalz'able, stays not lzis slauglzter al tlte*
Nereid’s command, and is turned into tlte ‘W olf Slone ’. Peleus
makes his way to ,Magnesicn and llzcre at last is absolvea' from llis
bloodguiltiness by K ing A castus]

This episode is derived from Nicander. See Introduction xiii.

350. ferat: subj. because in orat. obl. after edere.

351. trepidi oris. Genitive of description with T rachinius (sc.
heros or rex). The line aptly marks the kindly solicitude of the
monarch sor his guest.

352. This speech of the herdsman shows little of Ovid's undoubted
dramatic power. It is too prolix and bombastic to befit a speaker
of humble rank (and scant of breath, 347), and the descriptions
which it contains, however elegant, are quite inappropriate at
a time when ‘ delay is ruinous ⁹, 376.

353. medio orbe: poetical abl. of ‘place where’ without pre-
position.

354. videret : ‘ subj. by assimilation ⁹ to that of the sentence on
which it depends, ‘ cum . . . respiceret ’.

The meaning is that the distance already traversed, on which the
Sun looks back, is as great as that which still lies before him,
i.e. he has completed the half of his career. We are thus told
three times (cf. medio orbe and altissimus in the previous line) that
it was noon·day. See Introd. xvi.

359. templa: 8n.

subsunt, ‘lies hard by.' Some of the older commentators
proposed to take the line as referring to the home of Nereus on the
ocean floor, but had this been the poet’s meaning, he would have
expressed it differently.

360. trabibus, ‘tree-trunks,’ as often, 642.

361. Nereides: cf. 380. The wolf is the chosen instrument of
Psamathe’s vengeance, 267 n., and naturally makes his lair in the
vicinity os her temple.
