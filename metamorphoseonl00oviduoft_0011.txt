LIFE AND WORKS OF OVID vii

and we do Ovid 'no injustice when we assume that the factos his
wife's influential connexions at court inspires his letters to her from
exile with some portion, at least, of their ardour.

Up to the year 8 A. D. his same as a poet rested on the following
works :—

(1) The Amores-in five books, restricted in a second edition to
three. The main theme of this collection is bis amour with one
Corinna, whose identity is uncertain.

(2) The Heroides—a number of imaginary love-letters from the
famous heroines of antiquity to their lovers and husbands.

(3) The ,Hedera a tragedy which has not come down to us.
Ancient critics accounted this his greatest work.¹

(4) The Ars Amatoria, published about 2 B.c.‚ a ‘ didactie
poem’ on the art of winning love—perhaps the most brilliant, as it
is the most licentious, of his extant composition&

(5) The Remedia Α moris—a sort of recantation of the above (⁶ sor
the most part as bad as the disease '.—Church).

( 6) The Metamorphoses—a hexameter poem, in fifteen books,
devoted to stories of the Greek and Roman mythology—his most
ambitious and elaborate work.

(7) The Fasti—a nmional calendar, of which the first six books
are extant. Perhaps more were never written.

At the end of the year 8 a heavy blow fell. Augustus issued an
edict sor his banishment, and ordered him to take up his abode
among the Getae at Tomi (modern Kustendje} on the Black Sea. At
the same time his books were removed from the public libraries. His
immoral verse cannot but have offended and even affronted Augustus,
who had seriously set himself to reform the society ofwhich he had
been the saviour. 'l'he emperor's resentment was possibly all the
deeper from his realization that ‘he who makes a nation's laws ’
wields less real power over men's minds than ⁴ he who makes its
ballads '‚'·' though, to be sure, Ovid's poetry was far less a cause than
a symptom os the demoralization os society. But the immorality of

vir praestare potuerit, si ingenio suo imperare quam indulgere maluisset'.

the grqffill at Pompeii os verses from the Amores and Ars ,lunum-la, anu}
