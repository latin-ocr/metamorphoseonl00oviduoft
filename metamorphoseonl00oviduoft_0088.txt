exposed to evil of any kind '. These uses are common in our
own older writers. Bunyan ‘The town of Mansoul . . . now lies
obnoxious to its foes ’. obnoxius never = offensive, hatesul, a sense
which attached to the English derivative, because those whom we
desire to punish are commonly those whom we dislike. Trench,
§elect Glossary.

(or, according to others, sourteen) days in winter or early spring
the sca was supposed to be calm and serene. The nests are said
to float on the waves spondentibus ‹tc-quare. 746), because they were
osten washcd oss the rocks whcrcon they were built (the ‘alcyonum
scopulis’ of l'rop. iii. 7. 61) and were thus sabled to be placed on
