METAMORPHOSES XI. 2—7

It has also a secondary sense, ‘ obedient.’ Compare Milton's use of
obsequious, P. L. vi. 781 ‘ th' uprooted hills . . . heard his voice and
went obsequious '; ducit combines the ideas of ‘ lead ’ and ‘ charm ’.

3. nurus Ciconum, ‘the Ciconian dames.’ nurus is frequently
synonymous with ‘ women', when it is followed by a genitive, as here,
or by an adjective (ii. 366 ‘ nuribus gestanda Latinis'). See the dis-
cussion of the use of nurus by Prof. W. R. Hardie, in the Classical
Review, vol. xviii, p. 158. So nmtres, 69. The plurals of nurus
and mater are metrically more convenient than that of semmei,
which dactylic verse will not admit. For the same reason the epic
poets have to find equivalents forsiltZ such as ηᾶίῑ, iuvenes, δερ.

Ciconum. Poetical for ‘ Thracian ’. The Cicones were a
Thracian tribe which dwelt near Mt. Ismarus.

3. lymphata, ‘ frenzied,' with the Bacchic enthusiasm. The
origin of this curious word is obscure. Probably Nympha and
lympha were connected or confused in popular etymology, so
that the Greek νυμφόληπτος- Nymph possessed, benymphed—came
to be rendered in Latin by lymphatus. For the belief that the
Nymphs possessed the power of inspiring madness and delirium,
see Heroides, iv. 49-50, where Phaedra likens herself in her fits of
frenzy to

‘quas semideae Dryades Faunique bicornes
numine contactas attonuere suo '.

Similar formations are panic, lunatic, and (in the comedians)
cerritus and lamnzlus. ’

4. pectora. This is an instance of the common poetical con-
struction of the ‘retained accusative ', by which the objective accus.
depends directly on a passive verb, as if the verb were still active.
It is an imitation of the Greek accus. after the past part. os passive
and middle verbs. Some of the instances approximate to and run
into the accus. of ‘ part affected “ οι· ‘reference ', e. g. saucius caput.
So pectora here might be taken under either head, bnt since it is
governed by a past participle, it is more conformable to the usage
of the Latin poets to regard it as a ‘retained accusative ’. Trans.
⁴ their breasts covered '.

5. sociantem. Milton, L'Aqu-ra, ‘ Soft Lydian aits, married to
immortal verse '. Hor. vdes, iv. 9. 4 ‘verba loquor socianda chordis’.

6. iactato crine per auras. A characteristic pose of the
bacchantes, as represented in am‘ient art. Cf. Cat. Attis 23 ⁴ ubi
capita Maenades vi iaciunt lunden-igcrac! and Iiur. Bacchae 864,
where Tyrrell quotes Seu. Troada, 473 ‘een-icc fusam dissipans
iacta comam.'

7. nostri contemptor. Cf. x. 79 and Vei-g. (ἵε-(1ης. iv. 516
‘ Nulla Venus, non ulli animum flexere hymenaei “, and 520 ‘spretae
Ciconum matres '.
