METAMORPHOSES XI. 155—162

comparison here noted. The stock example is Homer, Il. xvii. 51
κόμαι Χαρίτεσσιν ὁμοῖαι-ί hair like to (that os) the Graces.‘ Horace,
a master of matchless conciseness, much affects the usage. Cf. espe-
cially Odes iii. 6. 46 and Page’s note, and see below 163, 410, 417 for
similar brevity.

156. sub, ‘before (lit. under) Tmolus as umpire.’ Sub as in
‘ adhuc sub iudice lis est'.

impar: since Apollo is the god of song, and his instrument
the cithara, while Pan, the shepherd god, plays on his rustic pipes.
The poet's description of Apollo (165-9), probably drawn in detail
from some actual masterpiece of statuary like the Apollo C itharoedus
in the Vatican‚ skilfully emphasizes the contrast between the con-
testants. The story is more usually told of Marsyas, and has been
treated by Matthew Arnold in Empedocles on Etna and by Sir
Lewis Morris in lee Epic (gfflades. Ovid describes his flaying
Met. vi. 382 et seqq„ but only mentions the contest.

157. Observe the ingenuity with which the poet manages the

details of this daring personification.

senior = senex, as often in the poets‚ and always, it is said, in
Ovid. It is here an honourable title like pater (132). Compare its
English derivatives sire, sir.

iudex: predicative, ‘as adjudicator!

consedit, ‘is set! One οἱ several technical terms of the law
courts in this passage—sub iudice, 156, nulla mom est, 161, aderat,
162. For consedit cf. xiii. 1 ‘ consedere duces ’, διε. (of the session
of Greek chieftains, met to award the arms of the dead Achilles).

157—8. aures liberat: arboribus. From his ears he brushes
back, as if hair, the trees with which his height is wooded, in order
to hear with all distinctness the music of the competitors.

158. caerula: by the common transference of the colours of
natural objects to their corresponding deities (398 n.), Tmolus is
here poetically seigned to have dark-blue hair, because the hazy
summits of distant mountains show bluish to the view. In support
of this explanation one might perhaps quote Shakespeare, Antouy
and Cleopatra, iv. 12:

‘Blue promontory, with trees upon 't.'

Caerulus, however (like πορφύρεος), may mean simply ‘dark ⁹.

162. barbarico here = Phrygian. The Phrygian deity naturally
elects to play a Phrygian air on his pipes. The word has a secondary
sense of ‘uncouth ’‚ ‘ outlandisl1‚’ in contrast with docto and dulce-
dine below (169, 170). Observe the effective juxtaposition of
barbarico and Alidem. lt was to be expected that the dull and
tasteless Phrygiam king would be charmed by the wild and
exciting strains of the Phrygiam music, which stood in proverbial
contrast to the soberness of the ‘Dorian mood'. The whole
