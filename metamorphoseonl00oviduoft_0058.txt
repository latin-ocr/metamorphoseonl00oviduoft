METAMORPHOSES XI. 1 26-137

126. i.e. his palate rejects the transformed draught. K. expands :

‘ (it) chokes his heaving gorge and drips
And dribbles from his lips in fluid gold.'
videres : ‘ potential ’ subj., 84 n.

127. divesque miserque. An oxymoron, like Hor. Odes, iii. 16.
28 ‘ magnas inter opes inops '. Another in 133.

130. meritus ε adoerbially, ‘ deservedly.'

ab. Osten inserted by the poets (and Livy) where a simple
abl. (instrumental) would seem more natural. Perhaps personifica-
tion is intended here, the gold being represented as the actual
tormentor or mocker.

131. splendida, ‘glistening‚’ ‘burnished' with gold, referring
either to his arms, or, perhaps, to the sleeves of his garment. Cf. 136
‘ circumlitus auro ’.

132. Lenaee: see Vocabulary.

pater. Gods and beneficent powers are often so styled. The
title is even extended to great rivers—the Tiber (Verg. Georg. iv.
369) and the Nile (Tib. i. 7. 23). Compare also ‘pater Ennius'
(Horace and Propertius), like our Dan Chaucer (Dan=Dominus).
When pateris used in this way, the idea of majesty predominates
over that of age. In 99 Bacchus is referred to as iuvenis, and in
iv. 17 Ovid speaks of his ‘ inconsumpta iuventas '.

133. specioso damno: K„ ‘glittering curse ’, an instance of
‘oxymoron ²—the figure by which words of contrary force are
effectively conjoined. A well-known instance is Tennyson's

‘His honour rooted in dishonour stood,
And saith unfaithful kept him falsely true.’
eripe: sc. me.

134. It is better to punctuate at numen, and thus make ‘mite
deum numen’ a separate sentence, supplying est. lf it is taken as
attributive to Bacchus, deum numen must be merely a periphrasis
for deus, ‘the kindly godhead.’ But the plural os the genitive
seems strange.

peccasse: sc. se. R.§ 1346. Ovid is fond of this omission,
where there can be no ambiguity.

135. ‘ Annuls the boon granted as the faithful persormance of his
promise ’. Merkel reads factique· fide, ‘as proos os what he had -
done ⁹, i. e. that he had restored him to his former estate.

136. neve = cl ne, the e! going with ast, the nc with maneas.
The poets, and Ovid in particular, allow the et which connects ait
or inquil with the preceding sentences to coalesce with a negative
belonging to the speech itself: 263 ⁴ neque ’ ait ‘sinc numine vineis'.

male : 102 n.

137. magnis marks Sardes as the metropolis os Lydia. Cf. Her.

vii. 165 ‘magnis Mycenis'.
amnem: the Pactolus, 87.
