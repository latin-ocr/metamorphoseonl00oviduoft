ΜΕΤΑ MORPHOSES XI. 94-102

94. simul : conjunction=simulatquc¹.
sacrorum: sc. Bacchi. Cf. 68.
95. adventu : abl. of cause, ‘in honour os.'
geniah'ter, ‘ with festal chee1·.' The Romans believed that
every man had a genius—a sort of lise spirit or guardian angel,
which shared his joys and sorrows throughout life. Genius is, in
fact, often employed fancisully as the equivalent of a man’s sels, his
animus. Accordingly to treat the genius well (ιήτίηζςνιντ genio)
comes to mean to enjoy oneself, and genialis dies—a day given to
the genius = a sestal day.
96. bis quinque. In expressions of multiplicatiori prose uses the
distributive (here bis quinos).
iunctas z sc. diebus.
98. Lucifer: the morning star, harbinger of day (Greek
φωσφόρος). Cf. ii. 114:

‘Diffugiunt stellae quarum agmina cogit
Lucifer et caeli statione novissimus exit.'

The metaphor is a military one, ‘ brings up the rear of the starry
host‚’ and is different from Milton's in P. L. v, 708 :

‘ The morning star that guides the starry flock.'

The same star, appearing at evening‚ is called Hesperus; this dual
functionis commemorated by many poets,ancicnt and modern—Plato
(trans. by Shelley), Cinna, Cicero. Tennyson, ln Allernmz'am, cxxi :

‘ Sweet Hesper Phosphor, double name,
For what is one, the first, the last,
Thou like my present and my past,

Thy place is changed; thou art the samc.’

undecimus, ‘ sor the eleventh time)

99. The addition of iuveni shows that Ovicl intends a pleasantry.
King translates :

‘The truant Elder to his Pupil bore!

100. inutile: as osten, not simply ‘useless ‘‚ ‘bootless’ (Le.
shown by the result to be such), but by litotes ⁵ hurtful ⁹, ‘baneful ¹.
So xiii. 38 ‘ sibi inutilior ’.

101. altore recepto: 68 n.

102. male usurus donis, ‘fated to find the boon his bane.'
male, as osten,=‘to his hurt ⁹, ‘disastrously ¹, not ‘ badly ’, for the
fatal nature of the gift would preclude any right use. Cf. 136, and
ii. 148 (of Phaethon) ‘ male optatos axes! (sti here not ‘ use ’ but
‘ find ’‚ ⁴ experience’‚ a common sense. For the future part. used
of not ‘intention ’ but ‘ destiny ’ cf. also nocitura, 104. [1 incline
to take male as = non (as in Verg. Aen. iv. 8 ‘sic unani-
mam adloquitur male sana sororem ⁹) and uti as ''enjoy’ (like
χρῆσθαι). Then ‘ male usurus donis’=‘destined to get little good
