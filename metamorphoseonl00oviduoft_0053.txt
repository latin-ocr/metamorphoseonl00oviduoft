over, is osten represented as the patron and inspirer of poets. Cf.
Hor. Epist. ii. 2. 77 ⁴ scriptorum chorus . . . rite cliens Bacchi '.

69. matres: 31¹·

Edonidas: poetical for ‘ Thracian ¹. The worship of Bacchus
was especially popular among the Thracian tribes, who were pro-
verbially hard drinkers. Thus lidonis in the Latin poets is often
equivalent to ‘ Bacchante ’.

70. videre : an emphatic use, ‘ looked on at, witnessed ' the crime,
without attempting to prevent it. Cf. Greek ἐπιδεῖν.

72. traxit ε practically = hausit, ‘ drew down, rooted.' The
MSS. reading in quantum is un-Latin and unintelligible. 1 have
printed in the text Housman’s conjecture ‘ via quarn tum '. [Merkel
marks 71—84 as an interpolation, and certainly (1) in quantum,
(2) harum in 76 (? arlmn, an adverbial acc. = ‘ closely’), and (3)
vv. 83-4 are so questionable that he may be right in excluding
the passage. D.A.S.]

73—4. Order is: ‘ utque volucris ubi crus suum laqueis commisit,
quos callidus abdidit aucep5‚ sensitque teneri!

74. teneri, ‘that it is a prisoner.y

75. plangitur, ‘ flaps its wings.’ plangere, ‘ smite‚' is osten
used os striking the breast as an expression of poignant grief.
Milton, Samson Agonisles, ⁴ No time is this to weep or knock the
breast.’ Occasionally other parts of the body are specified—
the head, or the thigh 81. The passive is osten used reflexhely,
⁴ smite oneself,’ i.e. ⁶ mourn.'

trepidans, ‘ssuttering.’
l 78. exsultantem: conative‚ ‘ struggling to leap away, shake itsels
oose.’

81. conata. Instances of such ‘ frustration of effort ² occur fre-
quently in the poem, and are well calculated to display the poet’s
ingenuity in describing and varying the details of the transforma·
tions. See Simmons’ note on xiii. 569. Milton has imitated Met. iv.
586 in the scene in paradise Lost (x. 504) where Satan, on returning
from his quest, receives from the fallen angels, not the expected
acclamation‚ but ‘ a dismal‚ universal hiss ’, the assembled multitude
being transformed into serpents.

82. fitmt. · plural by attraction into the number of robora.

84. putes and fallare. Three points desene notice here: (1) the

‘potential’ subjunctive This is preferable to explaining it as part
of a conditional sentence, with a suppressed protasis—‘ is you were
to see them’. (2) Both the imperfect and the present tenses of the
subjunctive are used ‘potentially' . The latter is more vivid—a
sort of ‘historic ² present. (3) Observe the ‘ ideal ’ second person,
i. e. the ‘ you ' is imaginary and = ‘ one’.
