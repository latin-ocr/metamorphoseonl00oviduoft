111. THE METAMORPHOSJ·2S

In the Third Georgs'c, Vergil, opening with an invocation of Pales
and Apollo, the shepherd gods, justifies his choice of theme with
the assertion that the fables of the Greek mythology were in his
day trite and outworn. The Cyclic poets, Pindar, the Greek
tragediam, the Ahexandrines, and Vergil's own Roman predecessors
—all these had traversed the ground after Homer, and we need not
doubt that the poets of the time were beginning to feel that this
string in their lyre was growing sadly frayed. But the very antiquity
of such a heritage of myth, attesting as it does its possession of
permanent springs of human interest, becomes a challenge to the
innovator, and encourages a great poet to make it the medium for
the expression of his own outlook upon life; so our own Victorian
poets experienced in succession the fascination of the Arthurian
cycle. ln like manner Ovid, gifted with the fresh sensibility and
the exuberant creative power of the Italian race, set himself to
rejuvenate this heroic mythology3 animated with the new life he
imparted to it, it passed into the Middle Ages to furnish the poets
and painters of that time with their finest subjects and studies.

The Metamorphoses, though a narrative and heroic, is not, strictly
speakIng‚ an epic poem. Ovid, indeed, sustains the ‘ epic illusion ’
by the employment of the stock devices-—an occasional catalogue
of names or invocation of the muses‚ and the characteristic epic
diction with its figures and tropes. But some of this is ironical and
mock* heroic ; and the scanty and perfunctory exordium with which
the poem opens (if it he not a trace of its unrevised condition) is
perhaps a proof that Ovid did not take himself too seriously as an
epic poet.

The artistic unity of the poem consists not in singleness of con-
ception, but in the formal ingenuity of arrangement and transition
by which the legends are linkcd one to another. ln the epics of
