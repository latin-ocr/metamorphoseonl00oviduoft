METAMORPHOSES XI. roz-1 14

from the gift ', and we arrive at much the same meaning by a
somewliat different way. 1).A.S.]

103. fulvum: a stock epithet, as in the ‘ red gold ' of our
English ballads. In later Latin fulvus occurs as a slang term for
gold coin (like our ⁶ yellow boy ’).

venatur: jussive subjunctive, in semi-dependence on effice.

104. optatis: substantival‚ 12 n.

munera solvit. The expression is on the analogy of solvere
pecuniam, Sec. Bacchus duly pays the reward for service rendered
——the restoration of his strayed revelles, 101. But the same phrase
is used in 135, in reference to this same munus, with exactly the
opposite sense, ‘revoked,' and possibly solvit is an interpolation
srom that place. [It would be very easy to read flevit here, taking
the word closely with necllum: ⁴ bewailed the harm the gift would
do, and was vexed that,' &c. D.A.S.]

105. Liber: see Vocabulary.

petisset: virtual oratio obliqua, representing the god‘s thought.

106. malo, ‘the fatal gift!

Berecyntius heros. Like the Greek ἥρως, heros corresponds
to our ‘hero ’ only in its special signification of ‘ demigod '. Midas
had a divine parent in the person of the goddess Cybele‚who was
worshipped on the Phrygian mountain Berecyntus‚ 16 n. So ‘ Tiryn-
thius heros ’= Hercules, ‘Calydonius heros’= Meleager, and cf. 773.

107, ‘ He puts the fulfilment of the promise to the test by touching
this and that.' polliciti: probably neuter, used substantii-any.
fides may be either belief, saith in a thing, or that which justifies
such belief—a promise and its bana fides, or faithful performance.

108. sibi: i.e. his powers. '

Observe the characteristic variation of expression in this descrip-
tion of the king's alchemy, 108—26. Ovid is in his way as insatiable
as Midas, ‘aurea fingens omnia?

110. palluit, ‘grew instant pale.’ The perfect expresses the
suddenness of the transformation. The colour of gold is described by
the Latin poets as ⁴ pale ⁹, with strict propriety from their own point
of vieW, since the paleness of a swarthy Southern complexion is
sallow or yellow, ef. 145, 417, and also Cat. Peleus and The-lis,
100 (of Ariadne) ‘ Quam tuin saepe inagis suli-ore expalluit auri!

111. contactu potenti, ⁸ his magic touch! Potens, ‘compelling‚·
‘ prevailing’, is regularly used of niagic or mysterious power. and is
a stock epithet of Hecate, goddess of witchcraft. Cf. 308 ⁸ tactu . . .
potentis

112. massa, ⁴ nugget‚’ ‘ingotss

Cereris: 126 n.

113. demptum tenet=‘‹leinit et tenet '.

altis, ‘dignitatis causa '‚ as supporting the portals os a royal
palace; cf. 649.“
