METAMORPHOSES XI. 473—488

Propertius, and he has imitated himselsin his later poems, especially
Trisl. i. 2. This part of the book as a whole is vigorous and poetical,
but disfigured by the faults os over-elaboration and straining aster
effect, which appear in so much os the poet's work.

474. portibus: 811.

475. pendentes ε proleptic or anticipatory use ; cf. 341. The
sailors, at the hint of a breeze‚ cease rowing, and fix their oars to
hang facing the side of the ship.

476. ‘ They brace the yards topmast high, and crowd on all canvas
to catch the favouring gale.’

478. non amplius: adverbial‚ thus not affecting the case os
ae nor.

q medium aequor: half the distance.

479. puppe: puppis, lit. stem, is often used of a ship by the
figure which the grammarians call synecdoche—the representation
of a whole by one of its parts. So carina, 524.

erat = aberat. Cf. x. 664 ‘metaque erat longe ’.
utraque tellus : their starting-point and their goal.

482. ⁴ Forthwith strike all sail alost? iamdudum, ‘this long
while‚' is properly used of past time, and when used with impera-
tives‚ the order is to delay no longer to do what should have been
done before. The explanation of this vivid mode of expression, by
which an order is thrown into the past, is that the imperative
involves the idea of duty, and is therefore equivalent to a gerundive.
So in Cat. lxiv. 372 ε

‘quare agite optatos animi coniungite amores
dedatur cupido iamdudum nupta marito‚'

where iamdudum, though usually connected with cupido, may quite
well be taken with the jussive subjunctive dedatur which = dedcmbt
est. Such an instance may be regarded as transitional to the use
with the imperative. For other instances of the imperative with
iamdudum, Verg. Aen. ii. 103 ‘iamdudum sumite poenas ’, Ovid (?),
Her. xix. 118, xx. 80, Metl. xiii. 457.

483. antemnis. In the termination of this and similar sorma-
tions we see the remnant of the past. part. pass. which was common
originally to Greek and Latin. Thus antemna. = (ἷνιιτεινομένη and
alumnus (99) = alomcnos.

486. subducere remos. 'she oars, already (475) placed in their
sockets on the outer side os the vcsscl, are now ‘ shippcd ' as a pre-
caution against their being wnshed away οι· damagcd by the heavy
sea.

487. munire latus, ‘secure the sides‚' by stopping up the holos
made sor the oars. Caulking may also he incant.

ventis vela negare: lit. resusc the sails to the winds, i.e. surl
them.
