ME'iu-xixtoRl’HosEs XI. 332-343

332. ardentem: on the funeral pyre. Cf. Verg. Aen. xi. 200

‘ardentes spectant socios ’.
332—3. impetus fuit ire: impetus est = conatur, contendit, and

so by a natural licence comes to be followed by an infinitive.
This convenient substitute for the cumbrous or metrically incon-
venient prose construction with gerund or ut clause is generally
found in the case of substantives which are formed from verbal
stemS. So here impetus, from z’n-peto.

333. rogos: 8 n.

334. concita: proleptic or p1·edicative—‘ set his legs racing in
flioht’.

3*3335 pressa, ‘ galled.’

336. iam tum : even before his transformation.

337. plus homine = ‘plus quam pro homine ⁹, plus here =
velocius. For the fancy cf. xiv. 388 (of Picus, changed into a wood-
pecker by Circe) :

‘Ille fugit, sed se solito velocius ipse
currere miratur: pennas in corpore vidit.·

putares: 84 n.

339. The distance from Trachin to Parnassus is nearly forty
miles. Ovid here, as elsewhere, shows scant regard for geographical
accuracy. See, however, 329 n. In viii. 549 Theseus, journeying
eastward from Calydon to Athens, is held up by the river Achelous
in spate Ξ The Achelous is some distance to the west of Calydon.

341. subitis, ‘new-created‚' almost ‘ miraculous '. Ovid fre·
quently uses it of sudden creation or transformation: vii. 372 ‘ subitus
olor ' (of Cycnus transformed into a swan); Ibis 275 :

‘nec tibi sit tumidis melior Neptunus in undis,
quani cui sunt subitae frater et uxor aves’ (i.e. Ceyx).

Milton, Ρ. L. viii. 354:

‘With such knowledge God endued
My sudden apprehension.’

pendentem : proleptic, = ‘ ut penderet!

343. virtutem antiquam: the valour which was his character·
istic before his metamorphosis. ovid, in describing the metamor-
phoses, constantly dwells on moral affinities between man and the
animal world. and after all deductiori is made for the unreality
involved in some of these playful fancies, they yet seem to indicate
a genuine humanity of sentiment towards the brute creation. This
feeling is strikingly embodicd in the fifteenth book. where Pytha-
goras is introduced as the humanitarian advocate of a vegetable
dict, and the cxpounder of its philosophie-al basis of Metamorphosis
and Metempsychosis.

maiores corpore. Classical prose would have ‘magnas pro
corpore'. οι· less commonly ⁸ maiores qnam pro corpore ⁸. Cf.
