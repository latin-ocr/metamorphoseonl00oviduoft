METAMORPHOSES XI. 302—331

302. bis septem: 96 n.
318. peperisse duos : Philammon and Autolycus.
dis placuisse duobus: Mercury and Apollo.

319. nitenti. The best MSS. read here tonanti, others nitenti.
1 have printed the latter in the text, regarding Merkel’s arguments
against tonanti as decisive. He reads comanti, and compares
xv. 749 ‘ stellamque comantem '. But nitenti may with almost equal
probability be supposed to have suffered corruption into tonanti.

M. contends that the epithet must refer to Lucifer, not to

Jupiter, because (1) there is no good warrant in ancient mythology
sor assigning Jupiter as an ancestor to Lucifer; (2) if there were,
Ovid could not have omitted to mention the fact at 286, while con-
versely some reference to Lucifer is decidedly called sor in the
present passage; (3) progenitor, placed in such close connexion
with genitor, implies only one remove from it. Cf. proavus and avus.
h 322. sustinuit. = ἔτλη, ausa est, ‘had the presumption, hardi—

ood to ¹.

323. factisque placebimus: ironically. sactis is emphatic, the
phrase being equivalent to ‘ si non facie placemus, at factis place-
bimus ’. K. suitably expands:

‘ My face not please thee! Then,’ she said, ‘my hand
Perchance may please thee better.'

For que attracted into the speech 136 n.

324. nee mora, ‘ on the instant,’ no sooner said than done.

325. meritam, ‘ offending.’ So merui often = peccavi.

326. nee vox temptataque verba: perhaps a hendiadys, ‘the
sound of the words she essays to utter’.

sequuntur, ‘ come to her lips,' lit. second (her attempt to

speak); sequi and secundus are frequently used in this sense. The
line is imitated from Verg. Aen. xii. 911-12 ‘non lingua valet . . .
nec vox aut verba sequuntur ¹.

328—9. lit. ‘ And 1, grief-stricken, embracing her, suffered then an
uncle’s sorrow in my heart, and sent to console my fond brother.'

329. misi: Daedalion being away at the wars‚ possibly, 298.
lf we could suppose that he was fighting Phorbas and the
Phlegyae at Delphi, 414, Ovid‘s geography might be defended at
339. But this is no more than a conjecture. dixi is also read.

330. cautes. Cf. Hor. Odes iii. 7. 21:

‘scopulis surdior Icari
voces audit adhuc integer!

Eur. ,liedea 28 :

ὡς δὲ πέτρος ἦ θαλάσσιος
κλύδων ἀκούει νουθετουμένη φίλων.

Burns, Duncan Gray‚ ‘ Meg was deas as Ailsa Craig.’
331. natam ademptam : 68 n.
