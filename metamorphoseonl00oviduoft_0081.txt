METAMORPHOSES XI. 544-576

544. in ore, ‘on his lips) So below 562, and cs. Prop. iii. 7.
17:
‘ quid cara natanti
mater in ore tibi est?’

545. unam τ sc. eam.

546. vellet: ‘potential ’ subj., 84 n.

550. duplicata. See 521 above ‘tenebris hiemisque suisque '.

552. animosa = superbiens, and goes with spoliis. The ‘spoils “
are the mast and rudder.

superstes: sc. esi. The resistless wave towers triumphant

over the stricken vessel, even as a victor bestrides his prostrate
enemy, before giving him the death blow.

555. sua refers not, of course, to the subject quis, but to
Athon Pindtmwe, 164 n.

556. praecipitata: reflexim.

562. plurima: 140n. For the expression here cf. 544 and
Hcr. ii. 32 ‘quique erat in falso plurimus ore deus'.

564. corpora : poet. plural. Or, perhaps it = membra, but see 8 n.
(Α569. Πέετειωιι ; proleptic, like Vergil's ‘submersas obrue puppes '

en. i. 9).

570. posses : subj„ because nec quem = ‘nec talem ut eum '.

571. luce: lux from ‘ daylight' comes to mean ‘day’. Here
by a curious stretch of meaning it = ‘ night ’.

excedere eaelo : not to succour his son, but to shun the painful

sight os his death. So ii. 330 the Sun God, mourning the loss of
his son Phaethon, hid his face sor a day. And cf. Verg. Aen. x. 473.

[573-91. Meanwhile Alcyone, all ganconssious (ff lter husband's

574. dinumerat noctes: see 45 3.

induat and gerat 576 final subjs.

576. reditus: poet. plur„ 8n., very common with the verbal
nouns of the 4th declension. But there is possibly a real plural
meaning here. Tennyson, ln stlemoriam :—

‘Expecting still his advent home;
And ever met him on his way
With wishes, thinking, “here to-day,'’
Or “here to-morrow⁷' will he come.’
