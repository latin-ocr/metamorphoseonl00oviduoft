In the Tenth book Ovid tells how Orpheus, the Thracian bard,
bereaved of his wife Eurydice, descended into the underworld to
beg for her restoration. There his minstrelsy so prevailed with the
infernal powers that they consented to restore her on condition
that, in leading her away, he forbore to look back until they had
sully reached the uppcr air. This pledge he kept until they attained
the surthest borders of hell, but then ‘he paused and gazed back
on his own Eurydice, unmindsul, alas! and vanquished in resolve.
In that moment all his toil was lost: in an instant she vanished sar
away, like smoke that mingles with the unsubstantial air' (Verg.
Georg. iv, 490). In despair at his loss, he shunned the company of
mankind, disdaining the Thracian women who would fain have been
his consolers. XVandering over the mountains he led in his train
wild beasts‚ rivers, rocks, and sorests, enchanted by the music of
his lyre.
