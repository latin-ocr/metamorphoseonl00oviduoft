METAMORPHOSES XI. 41 1-425

fratrem secutis= ‘prodigia fratris secutis.' For the construc-
tion, 155 n.; the reference is to the episode of the destroying wolf
and its petrification‚ 346-409.

Itis strange that the editors do not remark the harshness and
obscurity of the expression here. May not ‘fratrem secutis' in
the sense of ‘prodigies attendant on his brother’ be a gloss on
‘fratris sui prodigiis ', which has ousted the latter half of 410.
[Perhaps the reading should be ‘fratris questu fratremque secutis ⁹.
‘fratris questu '=his brother's lament‚ plaint. Cf. 331 ‘natam
delamentatur ademptam ⁹. D.A.S.]

The order is ‘Interea Ceyx, turbatus anxia pectora prodigiis et
fratris sui et fratrem secutis, parat ’.

pectora: 4 n.

412. oblenimina. Ovid has as a decided liking for these neuters
ending in -mcn‚ as Chaucer for words ending in -cioun : purgamen
409, imitamen 626, medianum, and moderamen occur only in the
,llelamorpltoses.

The MSS. reading oblectamina does not surnish the required
antithesis to turbatus μείονα] oblem'mina is Korn's conjecture.

413. nam introduces a clause explaining why Ceyx, in order to
consult Apollo, was compelled to seek his shrine at Claros overseas.
instead of visiting the world-famous oracle at Delphi, which was
not sar distant from Trachin, 339 n.

415. consilii: for the gen. cf. vi. 268 ‘tam subitae matrem certam
fecere ruinae ’. Classical prose would have ‘ cerlz'orem facit de
consilio ’ (consilii also, but not in Caesar). This genitive is an exten-
sion of the use alter adjectives of knowledge and ignorance.

417. buxo simillimae. For construction, 155 n. The pale-
ness of the yellow boxleaf was proverbial. See note on palluit, 110.

419. ter, ‘again and again,’ of an indefinite number of times.
So ‘terque quaterque ’ and other combinations.

422. cura mei : attracted into the relative clause.

423. securus, ‘ untroubled‚’ ⁴ unconcerned '. Securus conformably
to its derivation (se = sine ÷ cura) implies not safety but a man's
own sense of safety, whether this is well or ill grounded. This,
too, was the primary signification of the English derivative. Shake-
speare, Rich. ll, 11. i ε

‘ We see the wind sit sore upon our sans,
And yet we strike not, but securely perish.'

But the subjective sense tended to pass into the objective, and thus
the word became, to the impoverishment of the language, a mere
synonym for ‘ sase '. 'I' reheb, Select Glossary.

425. puto : ironically, as often when parenthetical. at pulo
osten introduces objections which the speaker then proceeds to
resute. ln this case the objection is purely imaginary.

425. tantum: [lie adverb.
