METAMORPHOSES XI. 57 6-591

The passage is a reminiscence of X* erg. Aen. xi. 49 (of Evander,
bereaved of his son Pallas) :

‘et nunc ille quidem spe multum captus inani
fors et vota facit cumulatque altaria donis.‘

578. Iunonis: because she, under the title of Pronuba (‘ best
bride51naid’)xvas the goddess of marriage, ‘cui vincla iugalia curae'
(Verg. Aen. iv. 59).

579. nunus erat,‘ was no more.’ nullus ls often found as an
emphatic negative in familiar writing and speech-the Comedians,
Catullus, and Cicero in his Letters.

582. hoc, ‘this last petition ’—‘ ut nullam sibi praeferret '. For
its sulfilment see 544, 5. There is a grim‘ irony’ in this line.

584. sustinet, ‘fendures 322.

funestas. 'Whoev er had committed homicide, or had come
into contact with a dead body, was held to be poll’uted. For the
necessary purification, 409 n. We have here a poetical extension
of this notion, since Alcyone had not been near her dead husband.
lt may be a reminiscence of Verg. Aen. vi. 149 (the Sibyl to Aeneas
of the drowned Palinurus) :

‘praeterea iacet exanimum tibi corpus amici
(heu nescis) totamque incestat sunere classem.'

587. iube . . . mittat: mittat isjussive subj., in semi-dependence
on iube. iubere is usually constructed with the accus. and infin.
For the subjunctive, 282 n.

589. dixerat : 379 n.

velamina: 8 n.

590. arcuato: to be scanned as a trisyllable. The rainbow,
according to the poets‚ is the bridge by which Iris descends to earth
and ascends again (632). For the whole passage cf. xiv. 829 (where
lris, at the bidding osJuno, repairs to Hersilia, who is mourning the
loss of her husband Romulus, to convey her to heaven to rejoin him
there) :

‘ flebat ut amissum coniunx cum regia luno
Irin ad Hersiliam descendere limite curvo
imperat et vacuae sua sic mandata reserre’;
and 838:
‘in terram pictos delapsa per arcus)

591. iussi: 142 n.
