pulchros, ‘ becoming‚’ in the double sense of ‘ beautiful' and
‘honourable’. That the former sense is present and indeed pre-
dominant here is shown by such passages as Α. Α. iii. 153 ‘neglecta
decet multas coma', and Pseudo—Tibullus iv. 219 (of Sulpicia) ‘ seu
solvit crines. fusis decet esse capillis'.

pios, ‘ fond,' ‘ wifely ’. See Vocabulary.

390. plena est promissi gratia vestri, ‘the kindness os your
