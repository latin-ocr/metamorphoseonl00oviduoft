PREFAC 13

Tm: text which Ι have adopted in this edition is less
conservative than that os Merkel, on which it is mainly
based. 1 have occasionally followed the recension by
Mr. G. M. Edwards in the Corpus Poetarum Latinorum
edited by Dr. Postgate. Sixty lines have been excluded
as unsuitable sor school reading.

For the Notes‚ l have derived some help from the
school edition of Siebelis (revised by Polle), and have
read, besides, Lemaire (for Burmann and the older
commentators), Merkel, and Haupt. Of English corn-
mentaries on Ovid, 1 gladly acknowledge my obligations
to Professor Palmer's Heroides, and to the editions os
Books XIII and XIV of the Metamorphoses by Mr. C.
' Simmons, and of Book VIII by Mr. W. C. Summers.

Professor D. A. Slater, of University College, Cardiff,
very kindly looked over the Notes and Introduction.
Ῑ have given some of his notes in brackets, with his
initials affixed; but these represent only a part of the
numerous criticisms, corrections, and references, os which
he has given me the advantage. To my colleague,
Mr. P. N. Ure, 1 also owe thanks sor a number os usesul

suggestions.
