was lest unhampered to take at the flood the tide which was to bear
him to mastery of the Roman world. Vergil, Livy, Sallust and Horace
had grown to adolescence before the reign of Augustus. Ovid’s career
falls exactly within the epoch of personal rule, and he stands alone
as a contemporary interpreter of the latter half of the Augustan
period. He was born too late to be touched by the bitter personal
memories of the Civil Wars, which lest an enduring impress on the
minds of men so different as the wistsul and meditative Vergil, the
genial Horace, and the melancholic and effeminate Propertius.
Nor was man ever less stirred by that ‘divine discontent ’ with the
present and actual, by which the poet is so often moved to regret
for the past or, it may be, to aspiration for the future. Ovid, on
the contrary, knows himself sor a true child of his day τ

‘ Prisca iuvent alios: ego me nunc denique natum
gratulor3 haec aetas moribus apta meis.¹ '

He was to have good cause to revise this judgement. For thirty
years the reign of Augustus meant sor him a tranquillity unruffled
by civil strise, congenial alike to the man of letters and the volup·
tuary; he was fated to have a bitter experience of the other side of
despotism—its unrestrained power sor evil over the fortunes of its
subjects.

Ovid, indeed, has a unique significance in regard to his genera·
tion. As Boissier well observes, in decided contrast with those of his
contemporaries who, like Vergil and Livy, had sought their ideal in
the great past of Roman history and legend, he is entirely a modern.
1t is not merely that he believes in his own time as the real ‘ Golden
Age’, as he says in jest ε he insists on regarding antiquity through
its medium. Even at the opening os his national poem, the Fasli.
he cannot deny himself a thrust at the antiquarinns of his day,
who must have frowned on his profane handling of the heroic
myths. ‘ We praise the worthies of old-time—but wc make the best
of our lise of to-day.'² And in his portrayal of the heroic age his
point of view is the same. His heroes and heroincs in the Heroides,
