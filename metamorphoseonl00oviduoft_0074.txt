METAMORPHOSES XI. 404—-411

illustrated in the lexicons. Cf. below 7423 iv. 396 ‘quae modo
fila suerunt, palmite mutantur'3 ix. 81 ‘tauro mutatus membra
rebello ’ ; xii. 34 ‘supposita sertur mutasse Mycenida cerva ’. This
abl. is akin to, but not identical with, that which Horace affeets‚
e.g. Otles, iii. 1. 47:

‘cur valle permutem Sabina
divitias operosiores? ⁷

Stories of this kind were suggested by the resemblance, real or

sancied, of a rock‚ stone, or other natural object to the animal or

object in question, cf. xii. 23 ‘ fit lapis et servat serpentis imagine

saxum’; and Homer’s story of the petrisaction of the Phaeacian

ship (Od. xiii. 156). Antoninus Liberalis asserts that this ‘Wolf

Stone ’ was long to be seen on the borders of Locris and Phocis.
mutavit: sc. Psamathe.

404-5. corpus . . . servavit. The punctuation in the text,
suggested by Professor Slater, gives que a more natural position in
the sentence.

409. Haemonio= Thessalica, as often. Haemon. son of Pelasgus,
was father of Thessalus, and Haemonia was the old name of
Thessaly.

According to the account inore generally received, Peleus sought
refuge in his exile, not with Ceyx, but with Eurytion, king of
Phthia, and it was for the bloodguiltiness incurred when he by
mishap transfixed his host with an arrow during the hunting of the
Calydonian boar‚ that he was shriven by Acastus. 1f the interpre-
tation 1 suggest sor 391 be correct, Ovid has drawn, suo more, from
both accounts.

purgamina: for plural, 8 n. Whoexcr was guilty osa serious
transgression was not allowed to take part in the worship of the
gods until he had been shriven by an innocent man. For the
nature of this purification see vii. 261 ‘terque senem flamma, ter
aqua, ter sulfure lustrat '.

In this story, as in the preceding, Ovid follows Nicander.

‘The episode of Ceyx and Alcyone, one of the most clmrming and
pathetic os all the stories, is a genuine sea-idyll. Though. as so
osten happens, overlaid with detail, it makes one scel with the lise
