METAMORPHOSES XI. 286-300

286. avumque Iovem: (the fact that) Jupiter is your grand-
sire‚ 218.
tempora: 8 n.
287. haee : deictic‚ with a wave of the hand, ‘the land you see ’.
pro parte: an adverbial phrase like pro rata, ‘in a (half)
share-⁹
vocato: the‘ future' imperative for emphasis.

288. qualiacumque: modest or depreciatory, as often. The
idea' is ‘this poor realrn of mine’ ..Cf Verg. Aen. i. 78‘ quodcumque
hoc regni ’—‘ this kingdom, if 1 may call it so’ .

utinam videres : imperfect subjunctive of a vain or unrealized
wish. Braffley, ξ 152.

289. fiebat, ‘ began to weep.’

290. Peleusque: 36 n.

291. hanc : deictic again-he points to the hawk hovering above
them.

292. putetis ε the correct prose construction with forsitan, which
is used adverbially with the indic. only in the poets and post-Classical
writers.

294. frater. All the MSS. read acer, and have a line at 293 ε ‘vir
fuit: et tanta est animi constantia tantum ’ (corrected ‘ quantum ’).
But the verse is feeble and its Latinity more than questionable,
while the omission of any connexion between 292 and 294 is quite
in the manner of Ovid. The bold but almost certain correction
οἱ acer is due to Bentley’s penetration.

295. genitore: Lucifer. For the abl. 271 n.

296. See 97 n.

29.7 mihi· the so· -called dative‘ of the agent‘ after the perfect
passive It is really a dative of interest, but the inference is made
that the person interested is the agent. M. 250 a.

299. illius virtus. An easy instance of the periphrasis, common
from Homer onward‚ by which the real subject of a sentence is
expressed as a genitive (or a possessive adjective) dependent on a
noun which describes its quality. Thus Homer s βίη Ἡρακληείη --
the strong Hercul.es Cf. Hor. ades i. 3. 36‘ perrupit Acheronta
Herculeus labor¹ ;·.Jux ix. 107 ‘Montani quoque venter adest’‚
humorously for‘ the corpulent Montanus’; Milton, l'. L. xii. 355
‘ XX here the might of Gabriel fought'.

300. Thisbaeas: aster Homer. who speaks of‘ dov e·haunted
Thisbe’ (ll. ii. 502). This is an instance os what is known as an
‘ ornamental ’ or ¹ literni-y ⁹ epithet‚ i. c. an cpitlict used not so much
to specisy an object as to recall to the rcader‘s mind the passages in
Greek pocts where the same description occurs. This tendency
was carried to excess by several Roman poets in imitation of the
practice ostheir modcls, the erudite aud pedantic Alexandrian school.
lhit eren Vergil has many insumens, eg. ‘Strymonian' cranes,
· ldnmaean ' palm-trees, ‘ Amyclzican’ dogs. ‘ Cretan ' quivers.
