85. Bacchus is not content with visiting the murderers of his
bard with the retribution described 67—84 : he shakes the dust of
the country off his feet (quoque going with agros). But nec satis, &c.‚

isf perhaps here, as elsewhere in Ovid‚ little more than a formula
0 transition.

86. choro here=Greek θίασος, Bacchic mut, throng.
meliore: as compared with his spurious worshippers the
Thracian Bacchantes.
sui : in emphatic position, ‘his beloved, favourite.’

88. erat: quamvis, on the analogy of quamquam, is osten sol-
lowed by the indic. in the poets, though in the best prose (in
accordance with its derivation—‘ however much ’, with jussive subj.)
it is invariably constructed with the subjunctive.

89. Bacchus is attended by a ‘bodyguard’‚ like the Roman
commander-in-chief with his cohors praetoria '. There is a humor-
ous reference to the unwarlike character os the troop of Bacchanals,
whose sole weapon was their pith wand.

90. at Silenus abest. A t, being more abrupt than scd, is some-
times used to mark the transition to a fresh story. Uvid often, as here,
by remarking the absence from a company, family, or city of some
one whose presence might naturally have been expected, proceeds
to account for this circumstance in another tale. So the 'l‘rojan
and Roman legends in Books xii xv are introduced by the
absence of Paris from the mourning sor his half-brother Aesacus.
Cf. also vii. 162, 515, xiii. 578, 640, and Introd. xv.

91. vinctumque coronis. This playsul touch is taken from
Verg. Ecl. vi. 19:

‘(Sileno) iniciunt ipsis ex vincula se1·tis.'
Τ ennyson :
‘the poet satyr
Whom the laughing sliepherd bound with tlowers.

93. cum. Probably the conjunction. Supply lraa't'dt'l, ‘at the

time when he also imparted them to Eumolpus)

cecropio, ‘Athenium-⁷ to distinguish him from his :incestor
os the same name, who was a king of Thrace.

cecropio Eumolpo: for the unelidcd vowel 17 n. The line is
also ‘ spondaic', i-c. has a spondce in the litth soot. This is rare
except with proper names. Note that in a ‘spondaic' line the
fourth soot mus! be a dactyl.
