M ETAMORPHOSES XI. 26-39

matutina.. Time is often expressed by an adjective in Latin
and Greek where English would have an adverb.
periturus, ⁴ doomed.’
28. non haec in munera factos, ‘fashioned for far different
service than this.’
non haee = alia by litotes or meiosis, i.e. the effective use of
a negative, instead of an affirmative, form of expression. Cf. Verg.
Aen. iv. 646 τ
‘ensemque recludit
Dardanium, non hos quaesitum munus in usus'.

Aen. xi. 45:

‘non haec Evandro de te promissa parenti
discedens dederam’ ⁴

and Hor. 0des, i. 15. 32.

29. arbore: abl. of separation, with direptos.
30. pars = alii, hence torquent.
neu desint. The irregular sequence of the present subjunc-
tive is due to the fact that the clause expresses the purpose not of
the action subzgrebant, but of the mention of the action (‘ that you may
not suppose that ⁴). So ne: dicam ί* not to say ⁹) is used without any
reference to the tense of the principal sentence. Cf. viii. 579 ε

‘quoque minus spretae factum mirere Dianae,
Naides hae fuerant!

The instance before us is less easy, since no verb of thinking,
δια, ἱ5 inserted to modify the irregularity of the sequence.

31. presso, ‘ down-driven)

32. fructum : i.e. the future harvest.

35. arma. The original meaning of arma (etym. ar* fit to‚fasten)
is fitting, instrument, implement. Verg. (icmg. i. 160 ‘dicendum et
quae sint duris agrestibus arma '; and Aen. i. 177, where Cerealia
arma is Vergilian for ‘ handmill ‘. lt is often used of the tackling
of a ship 513. From its meaning ‘ fit to' it easily comes to mean
what is fastened to one as a protectioni, i.e. defensive armour as
opposed to tela-weapons of offence‚ 382.

36. sarculaque. In the second or fifth foot of the line que in
‘arsis’ may be lengthened, but only before a double consonant or its
equivalent, and when another que immediately succeeds. lt is
imitated from the Homeric lengthening of τε. The present example
of a long que before the single consonant r is most unusual, but we
may suppose that this also is an imitation of Greek pmsody, where
the same peculiarity occurs.

37. ferae: adjective 3 ‘the furious troop.’

38. fata, ‘ death: ‘ murder.' Ovid is the first to use the word of
violent death, destruction. Γ

39. illo tempore : tempus is often used in Latin (like καιρός
