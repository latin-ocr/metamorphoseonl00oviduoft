fuit. Verbs expressing duty, timess, possibility, ἃς, regularly
have the indicative in the apodosis of a conditional sentence, even
where the protasis is an unrealized condition. Cf. Cic. pro ll’lismze
§ 11 ‘Si ita Milo putasset, opt ibilius ei fuit dare iugulum Ρ. Clodio
quam iugulari a vobis.y In the present instance, such a protasis
is to be supplied, e. g. ‘ had you not dissu aded me' Μ. 348 e.

700—1. There is a climax os fancy in these lines. She beoins
simply‘ Parted from thee, Ι am undone'. Then, since her intense
sympathy makes her feei all the terrors of her husband’ 5 death,

‘Parted from thee, Ι toss upon the wav es.’ Fin dly, her existence
being entirely bound up with his, ‘ Parted from myself, i. e. my
other sels, thee, ocean claiins nie! The MSS. reading‘ sine nie te
pontus habet ⁷ misses the point of the passage, and has been cor-
rected ⁴ sine te me ’; but ‘sine me nie ', the emendation of Heinsius,
is without doubt more Ovidian in its finespun (and misplaced)
ingenuity. See Introd. xvi, xvii. Cf. 'lb-ist. i. 2. 43:

‘at nunc ut peream, quoniam caret illa periclo,
dimidia certe parte superstes ero.’

and iv. 230 ‘nec longius ille moratus '‚ &o This use of the word to
denote time, not space, appears to be confined to the comparative,
and is very seldom found in good prose writers—see Lewis and
Short 5. v. D. A. S.]

pugnem = contendam, and is thus constructed with the infin.
instead of the usual ut clause.

705. in sepulcro goes with both urna and littera. She means
that the epitaph will read ‘Alcyone Ceycis coniunx ’.
