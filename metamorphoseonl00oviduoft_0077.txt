METAMORPHOSES Χῖ. 456-473

obvertimus antemnarum ’ ; (2) the ending in a word of four syllables,
cf. 17 and Vergil just quoted.

457. rursus: with horruit. Shuddering was a bad omen.

461. iuvenes = simply renngres, ‘the lusty rowers ’. iuvenis does
not correspond to our ‘ youth ’‚ sor it is often used without any special
reference to age. According to regular Latin usage, it means a man
in the prime of life—of any age between 17 and 46, during whiclt
citizens were liable to serve in the army. inf-entus is common in
Livy for the ‘ fighting-men ’ or military strength of a state.

quaerente moras, ‘ seeking pretexts for delay.' Cf. Tib. i.
3. 16 ‘quaerebam tardas anxius usque moras ⁹.

462. geminis ε the galley was a bireme‚ having a double bank of
oars on either side.

463. sustulit: from her swoon.

466. prima. tf this be taken predicatively with sngmz, the
meaning is that the first sight she sees on returning to consciousness
is her husband signalling from his bark. Thus the unromantic
Germans. It is surely more poetical when taken with the subject

out her husband's form on the receding vessel. A similar passage
is Her. v. 63 ‘hinc ego vela tuae cognovi prima carinae '‚ where
Palmer quotes Scott's Maid (gf Nez'dflatlz :

‘ Ere scarce a distant form was kenned,
She knew and waved to greet him.

473. pars. Cf. Hor. 0des,i. 3. 8(0f Vergil)‘ animae dimidium
meae' ‚and in colloquial English ‘better half? Sec: zlso note on

‘sine me me pontus habet' , 701.
