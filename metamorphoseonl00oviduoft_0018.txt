xiv INTRODUCTION

In Book XIII the suicide of Ajax is not followed by his transforma-
tion: a flower blossoms srom his blood, on which his name is
graven—the hyacinth.¹

In this way Ovid contrives to present what he calls a pet-peluum
carmen-—a continuous history of the world from the original chaos
to the last transformation‚ that os the murdered Caesar into a star.
Through his pages move the gods and goddesses of heaven, hell,
and the sea, the furies, nymphs, dryads, satyr-S, and the heroes
and demigods of legend from Deucalion to Numa. The work takes
all ancient my tholoo gy for its proxince and contains the most
brilliant and dix ersified pictures of man s emodons, w bether grave
or gay, fierce or tender‚ of his manisold activities, and of the
scenery of nature in all her moods.

Ovid commands all the antiquarian lore suitable to his design,
but he moves so lightly beneath the load which had oppressed some
of his sorerunners that it is easy to underestimate the extent of his
ειίιάἰῖίοιι.2 And, on the other hand, his originality has often been
called in question by his critics. Dlyden, whose judgement in this
case is as much to seek as his grammar, says of Chaucer and Ovid,
‘ neither were great inventors.’³ Now, our imperfect knowledge os
the ancient myths makes it impossible to pronounce with certainty
on the originality os particular epismles, and such stories as those
os Philemon and Baucis and os Pyramus and Thisbe⁴ (which are
mentioned by no other ancient author) are ascribed to Ovid's
invention only by more or less plausible conjecture. But it may at
least be said sor him, that where we are able to compare his
version of a story with those os his predecessors, it reveals in most

² lt is rar·er that this eleverest of the Alexandrian school sets hiinself to
exhibit 1115 large reading. 'lwo references may suffice. Medea, flying mer
Greece, sees beneath her many sites famed sor the rmnssormations which
