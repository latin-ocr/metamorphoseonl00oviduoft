METAMORPHOSES XI. 2 7 2-285

‘si quis mihi parv ulus aula
luderet Aeneas, qui te tamen ore referret,
non equidem ommno capta ac deserta xidererff

273. fratrem ademptum: 68n.

275. The three verbs venit, intravit, and reliquit, following
postquam, go to make up the protasis of the long sentence ‘quo
postquam . . . memorat. ’ In the apodosis memorat is the principal
verb, and ‘copia cum sacta est’ is subordinated to it.

27⁹6- 7. Construe: ‘reliquitque sub opaca valle haud procul a
muris greges pecorum (quos secum trahebat) (et) armenta, quae
secum trahebat!

256. trahebat. appropriately of the slow trailing gait of the
cat e.

277. sub, ‘ down in ', a pregnant use of the preposition.

279. velamenta. 1t was the custom for suppliants to bear wands
or olive branches tipped with woollen fillets. Cf. Soph. Ο. R. 3
ἱκτηρίοις κλάδοισιν ἐξεστεμμένοιε Verg. Aen. vii. 237 ‘praeferimus
manibus vittas ac verba precantia ’ (an instance of zeugma).

qui. Observe the distinction between the adjective qui and
the substantival quis. qui implies a description ⁴ what manner
of man '.

282. iuvet: jussive subjunctive, in semi-dependence on petil
103 n.1t is incorrect to explain this common constiuction by
supposing an omission of ut; iuvet is in its origin an independent
jussive, and is thus only partially subordinated to pella R. 1606.

contra: adverb

283. mediae quoque plebi,‘ even to the humbler sort’1much
more to you); media plebs, a common expression in Oxid sor the
‘ middle classes '‚ ἃς.

284. nec: 201. The emphasis falls on inhospita-‘no churlish
realm is this we own ’. We may compare the sentiments expressed
by Dido in her welcome to Aeneas and his followers, Verg. Aen. i.
562 sqq.

285. The commentators have discovered needless difficulty in
this line. Ceyx says that such favours as Peleus craves———a dwelling
in Trachin or its countryside—are sreely granted even to the
humbler os his subjects. But besides his own readiness to accede
to the request (‘ huic animo ’ = ‘ this feeling os mine towards you ⁸),
the suppliant is able to urge decisive claims (momenta) in the shape
of his renown and divine lineage. momentum (mov-menlum—the
metaphor is from a balance), like the corresponding ῥοπή in Greek,
has always the notion of a decisive motive‚ cause, or event. So
Lucan’s famous line, ‘ Momentumque suit mutatus Curio rerum “ =
Curio’s defection turned tlte scale in the struggle (between Caesar
and the Senate). Cf. Ovid, Epist. ex ,1²011t0,iv. 13. 49 ‘ quanta potes
praebe nostrae momenta saluti ¹.
