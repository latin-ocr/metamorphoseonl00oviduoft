METAMORPHOSES XI. 149-155

149. stolidae praecordia mentis, ‘ dull—witted mind’. praecordia
is properly the midriff which protects the heart. Hence it comes to
-= cor and then mens, for the heart was considered to be the seat of
the intellect. Thus praecordia mentis is merelya periphrasis sor mens. ν

15ο. nam introduces an illustration of Midas’s stupidity in the
story of his perverse verdict.

late: with prospiciens.
riget practically = stat. Either would express the idea of
immovable fixity.

151. in: redundant.

clivo utroque : either side of the mountain. Mt. Tmolus
is situated between Sardes on the north and Hypaepa on the south.

153. The reading in the text is Prof. Slater's emendation. ‘Ovid
may very well have written “iactat sua crimina Nymphis”—brags os
his conquests to the Nymphs. crimen is often used in this sense,
and is constantly by the scribes confused with carmen! The MSS.
give carmina, but this can hardly be retained, in view of carmen
in the verse following. See however 22 n. Mr. G. M. Edwards in
the C. P. L. reads flamina, the conjecture of H. Schenkl. This seems
to have little to support it save Hor. Oa'es, iii. 19. 18:

‘cur Berecyntiae,
cessant flamina tibiae?’

and in that passage the meaning is fixed by tibiae. There is nothing
to lend similar assistance here.

154. The invention os the fistula or shepherd's pipe (Greek
σῦριγξ) 15 attributed to Pan, Verg. Ecl. ii. 32 :
‘Pan primus calamos cera coniungere plures
instituit.¹
The Pandean pipe consisted osa number osreeds os unequal length
fastened together with wax. But the material is often put sor the
instrument—lmrundo, reed, 154, calamus, stalk, 161 ‚ and, by a
further extension, Vergil has avena, oatstraw. cannae, reeds, 171,
15 perhaps contemptuous. There are many imitations os this
usage in our English poets‚ e.g. Collins's Ode ta Evening:
‘ If aught of oaten stop or pastoral reed . . .'
leve: depreciatory‚ ‘trivial, rustic) Milton, Lycidas:

‘Their lean and flashy songs
Grate on their scrannel pipes of wretched straw.’

155. Apollineos: 811.
prae se = ‘prae suis cantibus': an instance of 'comparatio
compendiaria,the ‘ abbreviated c01nparison,a construction especially
adapted to the genius os a synthetic language like Latin or
Greek. Their syntax lacks a convenient nse os the pronoun like
our English ⁶ that of’, and they have to adopt either the cumbrous
int-thud ol repeating⁴ the substantive or the compendious sorni of
