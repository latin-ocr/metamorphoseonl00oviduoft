METAMORPHosEs XI. 617-644

is inconsistent with iacenl, 614. Ovid here, as elsewhere, is careless
in the management os his elaborate detail.

618. sacra: as being the horne of a god.

lgravitate: of the heaviness os sleep. So Cicero has ⁴ gravibus
ocu is ’.

62 ⁶.o pectora. · 8 n.

621. excussit sibi se, ‘shook himself off? Ovid cannot resist
quips of this kind. Cf. 125 n. Similarly in viii: 819 (of Fames and
the hapless Erysichthon)‘ seque x iro inspirat’.

622. quid,‘ uby!

cognovit: here = regnor '⁵²4‘ he lmen the goddess!

623. Somne: repeated for emphasis. Compare the more im-

pressive example in Shakespeaoe, Macbeth, 11. ii. 32—4:

‘Methought Ι heard a voice cry “ Sleep no more!
Macbeth does murder sleep”. the innocent sleep‚
Sleep that knits up the ravell'd slew-e os care.'

627. Herculea: an anachronism. Hercules’ death on Mt. Oeta

(383), from which Trachin was called Herculea‚happened later.
Trachine: ablative (in locative sense). Prose would have

the accus. (after adeant).

627-8. iube . . . adeant: 587 n.

628. simulacra naufraga: sor plur.‚ 8 n. ‘The shape of
him that suffered in the storm ’ (Dryden).

630. Similarly in viii. 812 Ovid says of the Oread sent to bid
Fames inspire Erysichthon with a prodigious hunger:

‘visa tamen sensisse famem retroque dracones
egit?

634. artificem simulatoremque: by hendiadys sor ‘ expett
imitator’. [The phrase is adapted from Prop. i. 2. 8 ‘ nudus Amor
formae non amat artificem! D. Α. 5.]

For Morpheus see vocabulary.

63 5. quisquam alter, ‘any os his sellows.’ alfer often =
neighbour‚ companion, &c.

640. For Icelos and Phobetor see Χ ocabulary.

'lhis is a common form of expres-sion in the epic poets‚
starting with Homer, by which one name is supposed to be given to
the same person or thing by the gods, another by mankind. The
most probable explanation os this curious literary conventionis that
the so· -c‘alled divine' names w ere merely older names which had
been superseded by newer coinages. l' eople were unable to under·
stand the meaning and deriv ation os some of these archaic forms,
and accounted sor their existence by attributing them to divine
ini ention.

642. Phantasos: see Χ ocabulary.

644· hi: Icelos and Phantasos.
