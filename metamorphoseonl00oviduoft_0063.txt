METAMORPHOSES XI. 1 69-1 93

conventional attitude. [Professor Slater takes status ipse differently.
‘ His stance alone (before he struck a note) bewrayed a master’:
this certainly has more point. ]

171. citharae submittere cannas: lit. to lower his reeds
before the lute. K. ‘The vanquished pipe confess the v ictor lyre.'
For the expression cf. Livy ii. 7 ‘submiss sis fascibus'.

174. neo: ‘but not'.

176. trahit in spatium, ‘draws out lengthwiseff Cf. ii. 3197
⁴(Scorpius) porrigit in spatium signorum membra duorum’ vii.

782:

‘nec limite callida recto
in spatiumque sugit, sed decipit ora sequentis
et redit in gyrum, ne sit suus impetus hosti!

177. imas, sc. aures, ‘at their roots!
posse moveri, ‘the faculty of waggingl posse is the object of
dat and has a substantiv al force. Cf. ii. 483¹ posse loqui eripitur’.

178. σῶοι-8,( all else about him)

in: in respect of, as regards. Here‘ at the cost of'.

179. induitur: middle voice, i. e. the reflexixe use of the
passive, hence the accus„ which must be distinguished from both
the ‘retained accus.’ and‘ accus. of r’espect (4 ¹¹·):

180. turpique pudore. A very difficult expression. Perhaps
an abl. of description, ‘his brows with their unsightly disfigure-
ment‚' but against this explanation (and the reading‘ turpemque
pudorem ’') is the fact that the deformity lies in the³³ aures, not in
the tempora. This difficulty might be removed by reading with
two MSS. ‘Ille quidem celat, turpique onerata pudore tempora.’
Cf. Fast. iv. 219 ‘At cur turrifera caput est onerata corona?’
Professor Slater thinks that turpi may conceal an objective genitive,
but that if the reading is sound it must be regarded as either a
stock epithet, ⁴ humiliating‚' &o or ‘ transferred ’ from Midas to his
feelings. In the latter case the words would mean practically ‘in
shame at his disfigurement'. Merkel brackets ‘turpique . . . temptat ’-

181. velare tiaris: the tiara or mitra was tied under the chin
with lappets.

182. longos, ‘ when grown long!

184. cupiens : concessive, ‘ much as he longed.’

187. terrae haustae, ‘into the pit which he had digged.’

188. K.: ‘and filled again the pit, and ’neath the clods

Stamped down the tale.'

189. tacitus: now that he has eased his breast of its torturing
secret.

192. agricolam: humorously for the ‘planter',‘sower ofthe seed!

ab: ι 30 n.
