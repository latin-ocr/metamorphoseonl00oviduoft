METAMORPHOSES XI. 8-15

8. Apollinei. Adjectives are frequently used in Latin in the
sense of possessive genitivzes R. 12773 Madv. ξ 300, obs. 3.
According to some authorities Orpheus was the son of Apollo and
the Muse Calliope, but the adjective may refer to the god as the
patron of musicp and poetry.

ora. A noticeal)le difference between the diction of Latin poetry
and that of prose is the use of the plural with singular meaning. This
usage doubtless originated with words in which the exigencies of
the hexameter absolutely demanded the plural, eg. silentia, 598, and
then easily passed to words whose plurals offer more convenient
forms, e. g ,εῦνρὄιῖ 564,νέιίῐίιῐς, 576. Byafurther extension the plural
was used sor the singular by analogy, ora and terga following cor-
pota, and so on. lt 15 osten possible to find a real plural meaning in
particular cases. Thus e. g. in 632 arcus may refer to the several
colours which comprise the rainbow‚ each os which is regarded as
a separate bom and so velamant, 589. Cf. on 564, 576, 750. But
such explanations are apt to be far fetched and fantastic.

9. foliis praesuta, ‘ since it was wreathed with leaves)

notam: i. e. a weal or bruise.

12, 13. ‘ at his feet couched prostrate as for pardon for such
srenzied daring.’

12. fun-ialibus: inspired or prompted by the Furies; cf. Erinys, 14.

ausis. The neuter of the past part. is osten thus used as a
substantive*admissuna susceptum, dictum, fadum, ἃς. R. ξ 561 b.

13. sed enim, ‘but indeed‚’ ‘however’3 so 401. This com-
binatim, like the Greek ἀλλὰ γάρ, is usually explained as elliptical—
but (the Bacchantes were not daunted by this portent)3 for . . .
The other explanation ls to be preferred, which m1kes c'nzm simply
an emphasizing particle. Compare its use in older Latin, Plaut.
Cas. ii. 4. 2 ‘Te uxor aiebat tua me vocare. Ego enim vocari
iussi -Ι did order you to be called.

14. modusque abiit, ⁶ moderation fied away?

abiit. Note the long final syllable, as usual in ‘arsis ’—the
metrical suess, when ii is followed by t.
Erinys. Erinyes, ‘Avengers‚' was the Greek name sor the
F uries, though they were usually spoken of as Eumenides, ‘the
kindly ones,’ according to the Greek idea of propitiating hostile
deities by avoiding the mention of their hatesul names or functions
’ —‘euphemism ’. Their usual sunction was to punish crimes. Here,
however, as in Verg. Aen. vii, where Juno summons the Fury
Allecto to stir up strise against the Trojans, they incite to guilt.
The singular is collective.

15. sed. Observe the change of construction here. lt is quite
natural. ‘sed . . . . citharae' represents the protasis in a condi-
tional sentence—‘ nisi clamor, &c ..... obstrepuissent, cuncta
forent mollita ’. But for the condition in the subjunctive is sub-
stituted an adversative clause in the indicative.
