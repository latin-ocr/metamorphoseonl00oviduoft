6510. urbem Haemoniam: Trachin, 409 n.

654. sine vestibus ullis: the garments of the Greeks hung
⁴1003er on the person. and so were easily disengaged or washed off
int e water.

656. capillis: for the simple abl. cs. 117.

657. refuso. The precise force of the prep. in this compound, as
used here, is not very obvious. Page's explanation seems hardly
satisfactory, when in his note on rejs‘zmdo (at Verg. Aen. i. 126),
‘used of a liquid which flows up instead of down‚’ he cites this
passage, translating ⁶ tears upwelling o'er his sace ’. Other MSS.
give prcficso, for which cf. 418.

667. ista: isle usually = ‘that os yours ’. But there are in-

stances of its use as = ‘ that of mine ’, when meant to be regarded
from the point of view of the person addressed. [Chiefly in later
Latin, e,g. Lucan iii. 125 ε
‘certe violata potestas
invenit ista deos‚'

where the speaker Metellus is referring to the ‘ tribunicia potestas '‚
and ista = haec nostra. D. A. 5.] 50 here llaec and isla both refer

to the same thing, ‘this news,' but ista has the special shade of
meaning ‘the news 1 have told you ². Cf. Hor. Esp. i. 6. 67 ‘si
quid novisti rectius istis, candidus imperti : si non. his utere mecum ³,
where Wilkins translates ‘ what is now before you ’. M . 486. [The
change from llaec to ista is odd, and the ablative rumoribus difficult.
Ovid may have written ‘ non mista vagis rumoribus '-—the story is
not wrapped up in a cloud of questionable detail. Cf. xii. 54 :

‘mixtaque cum veris passim commenta vagantur
milia rumorum.’ —D. A. S.]

669. lugubria: sc. vestimenta, ‘ robes of woe.’ Cf. Prop. iv. 11.

97 ⁸ numquam mater lugubria sumpsi '.
670. indeploratum. Note the melancholy οἱ the spondaic
rhythm‚ by accommodation to the sense. Cf. 19.
inania, ‘ghostly‚’ ⁶ phantoin.' The epithet belongs inore
